If you hit that limit, we will be returning a normal error message. You'll have every opportunity to handle that gracefully in your applications. Note: currently there are no options to raise that limit on a per-customer basis.</p>\n\n<p><b>Rate Limit Throttling</b></p>\n\n<p>Our previous sleep-based throttling has been removed. It is likely that we will add some sort of rate-limiting back to the API in the future, but that rate limiting will return errors when the limit is exceeded. We will try to give advance notice of the introduction of any rate limiting. To be notified of changes like that, you'll want to subscribe to the API Announce mailing list. </p>\n\n<p>It should be pretty rare to have either the Connection Limits or Throttling affect you unless you are trying to be abusive or have some code that is broken. If you fall into the latter case, see the use-case information below, or contact us and we'll be happy to help.</p>"
